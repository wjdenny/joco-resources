        <p>This project compiles information about local resources into a centralized, searchable directory. These resources include government services, nonprofit organizations, and mutual aid effort. The goal is to make it easier for people to find accurate, up-to-date information about the services available in their community and reduce the need for each organization to create its own list of resources.</p>
<p>The directory is designed to be useful for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Social workers and case managers seeking referrals for clients</li>
<li>Community-based organizations and advocates</li>
<li>Individuals looking for support services directly</li>
</ul>
<p>All entries aim to include relevant contact information, eligibility criteria (if known), and any notes that may help users navigate access to the resource.</p>
<p>This is an open source project. All data and code are publicly available, and anyone can contribute by submitting updates or new entries through GitHub. Community contributions help ensure the information stays current and relevant.</p>
<p>We are actively seeking volunteers to help with data maintenance, verification, and development. No technical background is required to help update listings; just a willingness to help improve local access to resources.</p>
<p>If you'd like to get involved, please visit our GitHub repository for instructions.</p>
