Use the search bar below to find local support services. You can enter keywords (like "food" or "legal aid") or use tags to filter results more precisely.

Here are some search tips to get you started.

### General keywords

Try terms like `rent help`, `counseling`, or `job training`.

### Tag-based search
Use tags to filter by topic, eligibility, or provider. Examples:
- `tag:#housing` – Resources related to housing
- `tag:#women` – Services for women
- `tag:#uiowa` – For University of Iowa students

#### Organization tags
You can also filter by who offers the service.

- `tag:#gov/dhs` – Iowa Department of Human Services
- `tag:#gov/icgov` – Services from Iowa City municipal government
- `tag:#ngo/ncjc` – Nonprofit organizations (e.g., Neighborhood Centers of Johnson County)
- `tag:#aid/itmaf` – Mutual aid groups (e.g., Iowa Trans Mutual Aid Fund)

You can combine tags and keywords as needed, for example: `housing tag:#women tag:#gov/iowacity`.

All results are community-maintained and may evolve over time. If you notice anything out of date or mis-tagged, you can [submit an update or contribute on GitHub](https://github.com/wjdenny/joco-resources).
